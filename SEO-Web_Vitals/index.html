<h2>Seo - </h2>
<hr>
<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.

Search engines crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).

Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.

SEO methods fall into three broad classes:

Technical
Tag the content using semantic HTML. When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.

Copywriting
Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject.

Popularity
You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site. <br>
    
    It is a Core Web Vitals metric that measures how mch your webpage layout moves unexpectedly while loading <br>
    <br>
CLS score > 0 - 0.1 is good <br>
0.1 - 0.25 - Needs improvement <br>
> 0.25 poor</p>
<br><br>
<h2>What is Core Web Vitals</h2><br>
<hr>
<p>
    Core Web Vitals are a set of three specific metrics used by Google to measure the "real-world" user experience of a webpage. Introduced in 2020, they focus on three key pillars: loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. <br>
Google uses these metrics as a direct ranking factor in its search algorithm, meaning websites with "Good" scores are more likely to rank higher in search results. 
The Three Core Metrics (as of 2025) <br> <br>
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Loading Performance: Measures how long it takes for the largest piece of content (usually a hero image or headline) to become visible.
Good Score: 2.5 seconds or less. <br> <br>
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) – Interactivity/Responsiveness: Measures the latency of all user interactions (clicks, taps, and keyboard presses) throughout the entire time a user is on the page. <br>
Good Score: 200 milliseconds or less.
Note: INP replaced First Input Delay (FID) as a core metric in March 2024. <br><br>
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Visual Stability: Measures how much the page content "jumps around" unexpectedly during loading.
Good Score: 0.1 or less. 
<br><br>
Why They Matter
SEO & Visibility: Pages that meet the "Good" threshold on all three metrics often see a boost in organic search traffic.
User Retention: Sites with strong Core Web Vitals typically have lower bounce rates and higher conversion rates because they feel faster and more reliable to users.
Business Impact: Data shows that when a site meets these standards, users are 24% less likely to abandon the page while it is loading. 
How to Measure Your Site
You can check your scores using free Google tools that pull data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX): 
PageSpeed Insights: Provides an immediate report for a single URL.
Google Search Console: Offers a site-wide report showing which pages are "Poor," "Need Improvement," or "Good".
Lighthouse: A developer tool inside Chrome DevTools for auditing performance in a lab environment.
